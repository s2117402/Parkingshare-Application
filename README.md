# Parkingshare-Application
### Breif Introduction
   This is a ParkingShare System based on my another project 'Registration-and-Login-System'.In this project,people can
   share their free parking space with people and they also can find a free parking space.This system has two terminals.One
   is the client terminal(Android APP),the other is a server timinal(Python Flask).Android APP is open for users and server is
   used to manage the whole system.
   
### Client Terminal
   This terminal is an Android APP actually.The app is formed with 5 activities.(Login,Register,UserView,ShareParking Findparking).
#### Login and Register Activity
   The first activity is the Login Activty,this activiey and theother Register Activity are completely based on an other project I finished,so I won't mention these too much here.

   the parking space).At first,you should name your shared parking space and give some description about it.Then press 'Get location' to get the GPS information(The system will mark your location in the googlemap),then submit it.Here are some pictures of possible cases below.
