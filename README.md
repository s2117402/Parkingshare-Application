# Parkingshare-Application
### Breif Introduction
   This is a ParkingShare System based on my another project 'Registration-and-Login-System'.In this project,people can
   share their free parking space with people and they also can find a free parking space.This system has two terminals.One
   is the client terminal(Android APP),the other is a server timinal(Python Flask).Android APP is open for users and server is
   used to manage the whole system.
   
### Client Terminal
   This terminal is an Android APP actually.The app is formed with 5 activities.(Login,Register,UserView,ShareParking Findparking).
#### Login and Register Activity
 Â  The first activity is the Login Activty,this activiey and theother Register Activity are completely based on an other project I finished,so I won't mention these too much here.
